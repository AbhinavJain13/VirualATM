Virtual ATM , an APP for fund transfer
I made this app for ICICI hackathon, using ICICI bank APIs like authentication api, account summary api, balace inquiry api, mini statement api and more.
using this app user can transfer money to any one even if they do not have bank account in any bank.
Enter your card detauls , pin ,OTP and amout of money then app will generate an 10 digit code ,use this code to ATM and withdraw that amount of money.
App have facility to login, logout,save cards, check current balance , mini statement,share,help and many more.
